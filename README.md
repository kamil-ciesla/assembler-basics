# assembler-basics
A few small programs developed with turbo assembler in order to learn the language.
I used visual studio code and MASM/TASM extension (version 0.7.0) created by clcxsrolau.

File naming explanation:
names are short because inside dos, the maximum name length is 8 characters,
the numeration is consistent with the time in which I created programs.
